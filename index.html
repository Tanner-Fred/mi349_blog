            <h2>Can the NFL finish the season with the growing covid issues?</h2>

            <p><img src="nfl-logo.jpg" alt="NFL logo"></p>

            <p>The NFL has had the unfortunate issues of trying to have a full 16 game season 
                with practices and travel in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first three 
                weeks of football went by rather smoothly with little to no issues relating directly 
                to Covid-19. But as we reached week four, tests started to come back positive and this 
                cause the NFL to make quick and drastic changes to many of the team’s schedules in order 
                to play games that were safe for all the players. Starting with the Steelers vs. Titans 
                game being rescheduled for much later in the season, and now the Patriots vs. Broncos game 
                has also been pushed off to another week. If the COid-19 virus continues to spread in the NFL, 
                it will be remarkably interesting to see if the front office has a better solution than moving 
                games around. Although this strategy worked well for the MLB, it is not plausible for the NFL 
                to reschedule games as easily due to the required time needed for the players to recover from 
                each of their games. Up until this point only one game per week has needed to be rescheduled 
                for another time, but when the time comes for more than one  game to be moved, the NFL will 
                need a better plan.</p>

            <h2>Lebron James: Cementing a Legacy</h2>

            <p><img src="lebron-jimmy.jpg" alt="Lebron James guarded by Jimmy Butler"></p>
            
            <p>As Lebron James journeys to game 6 of the 2020 NBA Finals he looks to cement his legacy as the 
                greatest of all time. Looking to complete his record-setting 10th Finals appearance with 
                another ring, this time with the Los Angeles Lakers. After a disappointing loss in Game 5 
                at the hands of a relentless Jimmy Butler, Lebron and the Lakers look to finish off the 
                Miami Heat in convincing fashion. This series is crucial to the legacy of Lebron James as 
                he has already been criticized by many for his not-so-stellar 3-6 record in the NBA Finals. 
                He is often compared to Michael Jordan in the discussion of greatest of all-time and Jordan’s 
                perfect 6-0 record in the NBA Finals, many give him the edge. But with a decisive victory over 
                the Miami Heat, and Lebron improving his record to 4-6, the gap continues to shrink. Lebron also 
                carries the burden of trying to win a championship for the city of Los Angeles after the tragic 
                passing of 5-time NBA Champion, Kobe Bryant, earlier this year. This could give Lebron the extra 
                motivation he needs, if he needs any, to dig deep and try and carry the Los Angeles Lakers to their 
                league tying 17th NBA Championship.</p>
